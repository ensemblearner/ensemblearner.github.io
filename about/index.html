			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I enjoy solving large scale machine learning problems. In particular, I have developed particular liking towards approaches non-parameteric bayesian techniques. I find the idea of writing a "custom" graphical model to solve a particular problem very attractive. I have also used randomized techniques to solve large scale linear algebra problems. Recent advances in Rand-NLA (like CX/ CUR factorization) have demonstrated how randomization can be used to solve TB size problem. In the end, what motivates is to deploy an algorithm to production and see how it make an impact across end user</p>
			<p> On personal end, I enjoy running, watching movies and traveling. I am also involved with <a href="www.pugpros.org" target="_blank">PugPros Rescue</a> in an attempt to make some difference in lives of our furry friends.</p>
